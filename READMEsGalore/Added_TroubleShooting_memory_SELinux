Here's a comprehensive overview of the troubleshooting steps and code snippets we've discussed to address your issues, including memory management, SELinux permissions, and enabling services on specific ports:

### Monitoring Memory Usage and Managing Swap Space

**Monitoring Memory and Processes:**

- To monitor memory usage and processes, use `top` or `htop`:
  ```sh
  top
  ```
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install htop  # On Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install htop  # On CentOS/RHEL
  sudo dnf install htop  # On Fedora/Oracle Linux
  htop
  ```

**Adding Swap Space:**

- To add swap space, if needed:
  ```sh
  sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile  # Create a 1GB swap file
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile  # Set correct permissions
  sudo mkswap /swapfile  # Mark file as swap space
  sudo swapon /swapfile  # Enable swap space
  echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab  # Make swap permanent
  ```

### Managing Firewalls and SELinux for Application Access

**Adjusting Firewall Settings:**

- To open a port (e.g., 8000) in the firewall:
  ```sh
  sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8000/tcp --permanent
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

**SELinux Troubleshooting:**

- To check if SELinux is blocking your application or service:

  ```sh
  sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
  ```

- Temporarily set SELinux to permissive mode to test if it's causing the issue:

  ```sh
  sudo setenforce 0
  ```

- To permanently change SELinux to permissive mode, edit `/etc/selinux/config` and set `SELINUX=permissive`, then reboot.

- To add a port (e.g., 8000) to SELinux allowed ports for HTTP services:
  ```sh
  sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8000
  ```

**Creating and Loading a Custom SELinux Policy Module:**

- Install necessary tools and generate a policy module from audit logs:

  ```sh
  sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils  # Install audit2allow tool
  grep gunicorn /var/log/audit/audit.log | sudo audit2allow -M mygunicornpolicy  # Generate policy
  sudo semodule -i mygunicornpolicy.pp  # Load the policy module
  ```

- Re-enable SELinux enforcing mode:
  ```sh
  sudo setenforce 1
  ```

### General System Troubleshooting and Optimization

**Optimizing System Services and Processes:**

- Review running services and processes to identify those consuming excessive resources:

  ```sh
  ps aux --sort=-%mem | head  # Find top memory-consuming processes
  systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running  # List running services
  ```

- Consider stopping or disabling non-essential services:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop [service_name]
  sudo systemctl disable [service_name]
  ```

**Addressing Issues with Gunicorn and Flask Applications:**

- Ensure Gunicorn is configured correctly to bind to the correct port as per `gunicorn_config.py`:

  ```sh
  gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py app:app
  ```

- For applications running under SELinux enforcement, ensure the executable and its dependencies are correctly labeled or that appropriate SELinux policies are in place to allow the necessary operations.

These steps encompass a broad approach to troubleshooting and resolving the issues you've encountered, including memory management, SELinux permissions, firewall configurations, and application deployment considerations.
