    <h1>Privacy Policy for Expense App</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 3/20/2024</p>

    <p>
      At Expense App, accessible from https://expenseapp.devopschad.com/, one of
      our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy
      document contains types of information that are not collected and recorded
      by Expense App and how we use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have additional questions or require more information about our
      Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us chjthomps@gmail.com.
    </p>

    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      Expense App provides an online expense reporting tool that allows users to
      generate Excel files based on their input. Our application is designed to
      process input temporarily to generate these files and does not store any
      personal data, input, or generated files.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Expense App does not collect any personal data from its users. Users are
      invited to input data to generate Excel files, but this data is processed
      on-the-fly and is not stored, recorded, collected, or shared with any
      third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      Since Expense App does not collect or store any data, there are no uses of
      such data to disclose in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure the highest level of security, Expense App operates entirely
      without storing user data. By not retaining data beyond the processing
      required to generate Excel files, we inherently minimize any risk
      associated with data storage and protect our users' privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Online Privacy Policy Only</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for
      visitors to our application with regards to the information that they
      shared and/or input in Expense App. This policy does not apply to any
      information collected offline or via channels other than this application.
    </p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>
      By using our application, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and
      agree to its Terms and Conditions.
